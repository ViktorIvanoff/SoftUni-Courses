# SoftUni-Courses

This repository contains different task solutions and projects in regards to my learning experience at Software University. 

The majority of tasks can be evaluated in judge assessment system at softuni.bg - https://softuni.bg/

The Repo is divided into Modules and respective Courses. For more information check the curriculum at softuni.bg.  

Each course that has evaluated examination in judge assessment system contains a Task Table in its folder. 

Task Tables have links for every task's solution code. You can use them for easier navigation once you get in the course's folder. If you search for some particular task just use Ctrl + F5.  Some of the tasks doesn't have examination in judge, but hopefully the code will help you out.
